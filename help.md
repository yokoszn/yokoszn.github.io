## Availability & response times

Services are provided by appointment. Response times vary with current workload; typical replies are within 1–2 business days. After-hours and weekend slots are limited and scheduled in advance. I do not offer 24/7 or emergency SLA coverage—please contact your primary IT provider for urgent incidents.

## Booking window

Most onsite or remote sessions are booked 3–7 days ahead. If I can fit you in sooner, I will.

## Custom PC builds (weekend-friendly)

Quotes are provided on request. Typical build/QA turnaround is 7–14 days from parts arrival. Weekend pickup/hand-over can be arranged by appointment.

## Invoicing & payments

Invoices are issued immediately after work is completed or at month-end for ongoing engagements. Payment methods and terms are listed on each invoice.
